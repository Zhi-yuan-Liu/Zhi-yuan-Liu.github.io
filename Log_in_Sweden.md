After finishing numerical analysis test, I came to Baoan Airport and then flew to Shanghai. Finnair set only 3 or 4 
check-in counters bringing a huge long line with people.
After a long time security-checking, I got in the plane with complex feelings. Hope I become better in that completely unfamiliar land. I miss my family and miss Wang Qing a lot.

First landed was in Finland Helsinki which I had to stay 10 hours in. After baggage storage, I went out the airport and went to the A-zone of Helsinki by subway.

Tanya Chua has a song called "the distance to Finland". I thought it must be used to express the distance between two lovers' heart, while now I am actually in Finland with eaxct "Finland distance" to Qing. It's upset.
I went to the central of Helsinki, nothing interesting but cold, with the sea lieing frozen. As I walked toward the pier, a crew member on the tour boat called out to me and waved me aboard. I was curious about how can this boat went around the ice.

After the boat aboroad, I found I was in a small island which is called Suomenlinna in suomi. I had my first lunch out of China.
Then I hanged out in the city, trying to find interests. I found there is a "forever bridge" which is popular in China. And I found 2 Chinese's name in one lock. As a wish, I will come back and keep a lock here if I married Qing.

At 6pm, I got in the plane. It was a short trip but gave me a big gift after I arrived Stockholm. My baggage disappeared, and no crew cared. I felt okay, for my first surprise aboroad. Then I had my dinner in MAX, which is fantastic.

 I went to see a movie, bought something in COOP. And then I went to the Arlanda airport again to find my baggages, with nothing happen. One mean stuff of SAS told me the baggages had been sent to my hotel(in fact nothing been sent).
 By the way, I found the price is astoinshing.
